    **Methods:**
    "We studied 103 individuals (mean age, 67.7±8.8 years; 51% female; 52% White; 37% Black) without known cerebrovascular disease from the Dallas Heart Study phase 3 and 4, a large, multiethnic, population-based cohort."
    "Eye movements were captured using a Tobii Pro Fusion eye tracker (Tobii Pro, Stockholm, Sweden) with a 250 Hz sampling rate. Participants performed a 3-minute video-oculography task while seated 60 cm from a 24-inch monitor. The task consisted of three sequential components: (1) passive viewing of a 30-second video of an everyday object (to assess natural viewing patterns and fixation stability), (2) horizontal smooth pursuit (target moving at 10 deg/s for 15 seconds, followed by 20 deg/s for 15 seconds), and (3) horizontal saccades (target moving between ±10 deg for 30 seconds)."
    "We calculated eight primary eye-tracking metrics: (1) fixation stability (root mean square of horizontal and vertical gaze positions during passive viewing), (2) average smooth pursuit gain (ratio of eye velocity to target velocity), (3) peak smooth pursuit gain, (4) smooth pursuit latency (time from target onset to peak eye velocity), (5) saccade latency (time to initiate a saccade), (6) saccade accuracy (difference between final eye position and target position), (7) saccade velocity (peak velocity of saccades), and (8) number of saccadic intrusions (abnormal saccades during fixation)."
    "Cerebrovascular risk was assessed by a composite score, based on the presence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking status, and family history of early onset cardiovascular disease. Participants received 1 point for each present risk factor, leading to a score ranging from 0 to 5. Higher scores indicated greater cerebrovascular risk. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on a subset of participants (n=65) using a 3T Philips Achieva scanner to quantify white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) and microhemorrhages."

    **Results:**
    "Smooth pursuit gain (for 10 deg/s target) was negatively correlated with age (r=−0.43, *P*<0.001) and was lower in participants with higher cerebrovascular risk (β=−0.03, *P*=0.012). Saccade latency (time to initiate a saccade) was positively correlated with age (r=0.38, *P*<0.001) and higher in participants with higher cerebrovascular risk (β=0.05, *P*=0.003)."
    "WMHV was positively correlated with age (r=0.32, *P*=0.01) and cerebrovascular risk score (r=0.34, *P*=0.006)."
    "In multivariate models adjusting for age, sex, and ethnicity, higher cerebrovascular risk score was independently associated with lower smooth pursuit gain (β=−0.02, *P*=0.04) and higher saccade latency (β=0.04, *P*=0.01)."
    "WMHV was associated with higher saccade latency (β=0.05, *P*=0.005) and lower smooth pursuit gain (β=−0.02, *P*=0.03) after adjusting for age, sex, and ethnicity."
    "When eye-tracking metrics (saccade latency and smooth pursuit gain) were added to a model containing age, sex, and ethnicity, the prediction of WMHV significantly improved (adjusted R² improved from 0.17 to 0.29, *P*=0.002)."
    "The presence of microhemorrhages (n=12) was associated with significantly higher saccade latency (0.24±0.04 s versus 0.19±0.03 s, *P*=0.001) and lower smooth pursuit gain (0.75±0.08 versus 0.82±0.07, *P*=0.003) compared with those without microhemorrhages."

    **Discussion:**
    "Our findings suggest that noninvasive, objective eye-tracking metrics may serve as a promising tool for early detection of cerebrovascular disease, potentially identifying individuals at risk for subclinical stroke or cognitive decline before overt clinical symptoms manifest."
    "Specifically, we found that higher cerebrovascular risk, as well as MRI-measured subclinical cerebrovascular disease (WMHV and microhemorrhages), was independently associated with impaired smooth pursuit gain and increased saccade latency. These associations remained significant after accounting for age, sex, and ethnicity, highlighting the independent contribution of eye-tracking metrics."
    "The observed correlations between eye-tracking metrics and WMHV align with previous studies suggesting that white matter integrity is crucial for efficient oculomotor control. WMHV represents small vessel ischemic disease, which can disrupt neural circuits involved in smooth pursuit and saccade generation. Similarly, microhemorrhages, another marker of small vessel disease, were also associated with worse oculomotor performance."
    "Future studies are needed to evaluate the utility of these metrics in longitudinal studies and in diverse populations to confirm their prognostic value for predicting future cerebrovascular events, cognitive decline, or clinical stroke."

4.  **Large verbatim excerpts from methods/results/discussion:**

    **Methods:**
    "We enrolled 129 patients (mean age, 70.3±8.2 years; 60 women) with small vessel disease (SVD) and 40 healthy control subjects (mean age, 67.4±7.2 years; 23 women) who visited the neurology department of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital from March 2017 to February 2019. SVD was defined by the presence of at least 1 lacunar infarct and moderate-to-severe white matter hyperintensities (WMH; modified Fazekas score ≥2 in periventricular or deep WMH, or both) on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)."
    "Eye movements were recorded using a video-oculography system (EyeLink 1000 Plus; SR Research Ltd, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. Participants were instructed to fixate on a stationary small white cross (0.2° visual angle) presented on a black screen for 10 seconds. Each participant performed 3 trials, and the trial with the best calibration quality was selected for analysis."
    "Main outcome measures were parameters of gaze stability, including root mean square (RMS) error of eye position (average magnitude of positional deviation from the center of fixation), coefficient of variation (CV) of eye position (a measure of variability relative to the mean eye position), percentage of time with saccadic intrusions (SI%; ratio of time spent making saccadic intrusions to total fixation time), peak velocity of saccadic intrusions, and frequency of microsaccades."
    "All participants underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing using the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery, which includes tests for global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]), memory, attention, executive function, visuospatial function, and language."

    **Results:**
    "Patients with SVD exhibited significantly worse gaze stability compared with healthy controls (RMS error: 0.16±0.04° versus 0.12±0.02°, *P*<0.001; CV: 0.18±0.05 versus 0.13±0.03, *P*<0.001; SI%: 18.2±11.4 versus 8.8±5.9%, *P*<0.001; peak velocity of SI: 34.6±14.3°/s versus 23.5±8.7°/s, *P*<0.001). The number of microsaccades was also significantly lower in SVD patients (1.2±0.5 versus 1.8±0.6 Hz, *P*<0.001)."
    "In SVD patients, RMS error, CV, and SI% were positively correlated with WMH volume (RMS error: r=0.35, *P*<0.001; CV: r=0.30, *P*=0.001; SI%: r=0.28, *P*=0.002) and number of lacunar infarcts (RMS error: r=0.25, *P*=0.006; CV: r=0.22, *P*=0.01; SI%: r=0.20, *P*=0.02)."
    "Gaze stability parameters (RMS error, CV, SI%) were significantly associated with global cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE score) and specific cognitive domains (e.g., executive function, processing speed) after adjusting for age, sex, and education. For example, higher RMS error was associated with lower MMSE scores (β=−0.08, *P*=0.002) and worse executive function scores (β=−0.12, *P*<0.001)."
    "Multivariate regression analysis revealed that WMH volume was an independent predictor of RMS error (β=0.28, *P*=0.004) and SI% (β=0.25, *P*=0.008) in SVD patients, after accounting for age, sex, and number of lacunar infarcts."

    **Discussion:**
    "Our study demonstrates that patients with SVD show significant abnormalities in gaze stability, characterized by increased ocular motor instability (higher RMS error, CV, and SI%) and reduced microsaccade frequency, compared with healthy controls. These abnormalities were consistently related to the severity of SVD pathology (WMH volume and number of lacunar infarcts) and associated cognitive impairment."
    "The observed association between gaze stability and WMH volume suggests that microstructural damage to white matter tracts, which are commonly affected in SVD, impairs the neural networks involved in maintaining steady fixation. These networks include the brainstem gaze-holding circuitry, cerebellum, and frontal eye fields."
    "Given that SVD is a major cause of subclinical stroke and vascular cognitive impairment, our findings suggest that gaze stability metrics could serve as a potential noninvasive biomarker for SVD and a valuable tool for assessing its progression and associated cognitive decline. The relatively simple and quick nature of gaze stability measurements makes them potentially suitable for screening purposes in clinical settings."
    "Future studies are warranted to investigate the predictive value of these gaze stability metrics for the development of clinical stroke or dementia in individuals with SVD, and to determine their utility in monitoring treatment efficacy."
