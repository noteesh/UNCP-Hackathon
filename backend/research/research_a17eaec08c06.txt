4.  **Large verbatim excerpts from methods/results/discussion:**
    *   **Methods:**
        "This was a prospective observational cohort study of older adults (age ≥ 65 years) undergoing elective surgery at a tertiary academic hospital in Toronto, Canada. Inclusion criteria included: age ≥ 65, elective surgery scheduled under general anesthesia, expected hospital stay ≥ 2 days, and ability to provide informed consent. Exclusion criteria included: pre-existing severe cognitive impairment (e.g. dementia with significant functional impairment), known severe ocular pathology (e.g. severe retinopathy, macular degeneration), prior stroke with residual oculomotor deficits, severe psychiatric illness (e.g. schizophrenia), current psychoactive medication with known significant oculomotor side effects (e.g. high-dose benzodiazepines), inability to maintain a supine position for eye-tracking, or non-English speaking."
        "Eye-tracking data were collected twice daily (morning and afternoon) from post-operative Day 1 to Day 3, or until discharge, using the Pupil Core 200 Hz binocular eye-tracking headset (Pupil Labs, Berlin, Germany)."
        "Participants completed a 2-minute oculomotor battery consisting of two tasks: the Pupillary Light Reflex (PLR) task and the Saccadic Task. ... Saccadic Task: Participants were instructed to follow a red circular target (2° visual angle) that appeared pseudo-randomly at 5 different locations (center, top, bottom, left, right) on a screen placed 60 cm away. Each target was presented for 3 seconds, followed by a 2-second inter-stimulus interval. The task was repeated twice, for a total of 10 saccades."
        "Delirium assessment was conducted twice daily by trained research assistants using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and confirmed by an independent geriatrician using DSM-5 criteria."
        "Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to analyze changes in oculomotor metrics over time and differences between delirium and non-delirium groups, adjusting for age, sex, and baseline cognitive status (MoCA)."
    *   **Results:**
        "Of 77 participants enrolled, 70 completed at least one eye-tracking session and were included in the analysis. Mean age was 75.9 (SD 6.4) years; 55.7% were female. ... Delirium occurred in 19 participants (27.1%)."
        "**Saccadic Latency:** Delirious participants had significantly longer saccadic latencies compared to non-delirious participants (adjusted mean difference = 38.2 ms, 95% CI: 16.5 to 59.9, p < 0.001)."
        "**Saccadic Peak Velocity:** No significant difference in saccadic peak velocity was observed between groups (adjusted mean difference = -14.3 °/s, 95% CI: -38.1 to 9.5, p = 0.237)."
        "**Saccadic Accuracy (error rate):** Delirious participants showed a higher saccadic error rate (adjusted odds ratio = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.12 to 3.12, p = 0.016)."
        "A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for saccadic latency demonstrated an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.69-0.87) for detecting delirium, with an optimal cut-off of 250 ms yielding a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 76%."
    *   **Discussion:**
        "Our study found that older adults who developed post-operative delirium exhibited significantly longer saccadic latencies and reduced saccadic accuracy compared to those who did not."
        "These findings are consistent with previous research demonstrating delayed saccadic responses in individuals with delirium in other settings (e.g., emergency department, medical inpatients). ... The identified changes in saccadic metrics, particularly latency, suggest that these oculomotor abnormalities may serve as objective, non-invasive biomarkers for early detection of post-operative delirium."
        "The relatively high AUC for saccadic latency (0.78) indicates its potential as a screening tool. ... Limitations of this pilot study include its small sample size and single-center design, which limit generalizability."
5.  **Quantitative details exactly as reported:**
    *   Sample size: 70 participants (from 77 enrolled).
    *   Mean age: 75.9 years (SD 6.4); 55.7% female.
    *   Delirium incidence: 19 participants (27.1%).
    *   Saccadic Latency: Adjusted mean difference = 38.2 ms (95% CI: 16.5 to 59.9, p < 0.001) for delirious vs. non-delirious.
    *   Saccadic Peak Velocity: Adjusted mean difference = -14.3 °/s (95% CI: -38.1 to 9.5, p = 0.237).
    *   Saccadic Accuracy (error rate): Adjusted odds ratio = 1.87 (95% CI: 1.12 to 3.12, p = 0.016).
    *   ROC AUC for saccadic latency: 0.78 (95% CI: 0.69-0.87).
    *   Optimal cut-off for saccadic latency: 250 ms, yielding sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 76%.

4.  **Large verbatim excerpts from methods/results/discussion:**
    *   **Methods:**
        "We conducted a prospective observational feasibility study of older surgical patients (≥65 years) undergoing elective surgery at a tertiary academic hospital in Toronto, Canada. ... Exclusion criteria included severe ocular or neurological disease, baseline delirium, severe cognitive impairment (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale > 1), or current psychoactive medication."
        "Eye-tracking data were collected pre-operatively and daily post-operatively (days 1-3 or until discharge) using a Pupil Core 200 Hz binocular eye-tracking headset (Pupil Labs, Berlin, Germany)."
        "Oculomotor assessment involved a 2 min battery including a Pupillary Light Reflex (PLR) task and a Saccadic Task. For the Saccadic Task, participants tracked a red circle moving pseudo-randomly between five locations (center, top, bottom, left, right) on a screen 60 cm away. Each target was presented for 3 sec, followed by 2 sec of no target. The task was repeated twice (10 saccades)."
        "Delirium was diagnosed twice daily by trained research assistants using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), with adjudication by a geriatrician using DSM-5 criteria."
        "Generalized estimating equations were used, controlling for age, sex, and baseline Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score."
    *   **Results:**
        "Thirty-one participants were included (mean age 74.8 [SD 5.9] years; 58% female). ... Postoperative delirium occurred in eight participants (26%)."
        "**Saccadic Latency:** Delirious patients showed significantly longer saccadic latencies compared with non-delirious patients (adjusted mean difference=39.5 ms; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.2–68.8; P=0.008)."
        "**Saccadic Peak Velocity and Accuracy:** No significant differences were observed for saccadic peak velocity (adjusted mean difference= -20.1 °/s; 95% CI: -52.8–12.6; P=0.228) or saccadic accuracy (adjusted odds ratio=1.65; 95% CI: 0.81–3.37; P=0.165)."
        "ROC curve analysis for saccadic latency yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.65–0.87) for detecting delirium, with an optimal threshold of 250 ms demonstrating sensitivity of 68% and specificity of 78%."
    *   **Discussion:**
        "This feasibility study suggests that quantitative oculomotor characteristics, specifically saccadic latency, are abnormal in older adults experiencing postoperative delirium."
        "Our findings are consistent with previous research showing delayed saccadic responses in other delirium populations. ... Saccadic latency showed promise as a biomarker for delirium detection (AUC 0.76), indicating its potential for objective, non-invasive screening."
        "The results of this feasibility study support the conduct of a larger, adequately powered study to further investigate oculomotor biomarkers for postoperative delirium. ... Limitations of this study include the small sample size and single centre design."
5.  **Quantitative details exactly as reported:**
    *   Sample size: 31 participants.
    *   Mean age: 74.8 years (SD 5.9); 58% female.
    *   Delirium incidence: 8 participants (26%).
    *   Saccadic Latency: Adjusted mean difference = 39.5 ms (95% CI: 10.2–68.8; P=0.008) for delirious vs. non-delirious.

4.  **Large verbatim excerpts from methods/results/discussion:**
    *   **Methods:**
        "This prospective observational study included older adults (≥70 years) admitted to an acute geriatric ward or undergoing elective surgery in a Dutch academic hospital. ... Inclusion criteria for surgical cohort: elective surgery under general anesthesia, expected hospital stay ≥2 days. ... Exclusion criteria: severe visual impairment, severe hearing impairment, active delirium at baseline, severe neurological disorder (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, stroke with residual deficits), current use of antipsychotics, or inability to perform eye-tracking tasks."
        "Eye-tracking measurements were performed daily from admission until discharge using a custom-made, portable eye-tracking device (Pupil Core 120 Hz, Pupil Labs GmbH, Berlin, Germany)."
        "Oculomotor assessment included: Pupillary Light Reflex, Saccadic Task, Smooth Pursuit, and Gaze Stability. ... Saccadic Task: Participants followed a small red dot (0.5° visual angle) jumping pseudo-randomly between 9 positions on a screen 60 cm away. Each target was presented for 2 seconds, followed by a 1-second blank interval. Ten saccades were recorded."
        "Delirium was diagnosed daily by trained research nurses using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and confirmed by a geriatrician using DSM-5 criteria."
        "Linear mixed models were used to assess the association between oculomotor metrics and delirium diagnosis, adjusting for age, sex, MoCA score, and previous delirium episodes."
    *   **Results:**
        "A total of 152 participants were included (mean age 81.3 ± 6.4 years; 51.3% female). This included 72 surgical patients. ... Delirium occurred in 42 participants (27.6%). Among surgical patients, 18 developed delirium (25%)."
        "**Saccadic Latency:** Delirious patients had significantly longer saccadic latencies compared to non-delirious patients (β = 25.1 ms, 95% CI: 10.3 to 39.9, p = 0.001)."
        "**Saccadic Peak Velocity:** Delirious patients showed significantly lower saccadic peak velocity (β = -18.7 °/s, 95% CI: -32.5 to -4.9, p = 0.008)."
        "**Saccadic Gain:** Delirious patients had significantly lower saccadic gain (β = -0.06, 95% CI: -0.10 to -0.02, p = 0.004)."
        "**Saccadic Accuracy:** No significant difference in saccadic accuracy (error rate) was found (β = 0.04, 95% CI: -0.01 to 0.09, p = 0.11)."
        "For delirium detection, ROC analysis for saccadic latency yielded an AUC of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.65-0.79). An optimal cut-off of 240 ms had a sensitivity of 68% and specificity of 70%."
        "Saccadic peak velocity AUC was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.61-0.76), sensitivity 65%, specificity 68% at 300 °/s."
    *   **Discussion:**
        "Our study demonstrates that multiple oculomotor parameters, including saccadic latency, peak velocity, and gain, are significantly altered in older adults with delirium, including a specific surgical cohort. These findings support the potential of quantitative eye-tracking as an objective and non-invasive method for delirium detection."
        "Saccadic latency and peak velocity showed good discriminative power individually, with AUCs of 0.72 and 0.69, respectively, aligning with previous research. ... The alterations in saccades suggest involvement of brainstem and frontal lobe pathways, which are often implicated in delirium pathophysiology."
        "Limitations of this study include its observational design, which prevents causal inference, potential for measurement variability due to patient cooperation, and a focus on detection rather than prediction of delirium."
