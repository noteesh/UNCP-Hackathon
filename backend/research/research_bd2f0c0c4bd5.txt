4.  **Large verbatim excerpts from methods/results/discussion:**
    **Methods:**
    "We performed a 3-year longitudinal study of oculomotor function in 23 patients with early-moderate Parkinson's disease (PD) and 24 age-matched healthy controls (HC). Oculomotor function was assessed using a video-based eye tracker (EyeLink 1000, SR Research Ltd., Ontario, Canada) at baseline and 3 years later. Participants were seated 60 cm from a 22-inch monitor (resolution 1920 × 1080, refresh rate 120 Hz) with their head stabilised by a chin rest. Eye movements were recorded at 1000 Hz."
    "**Fixation stability:** Participants were asked to fixate a central cross for 30 s. Fixation stability was quantified by calculating the mean absolute error (MAE) in degrees, defined as the average distance of the gaze position from the centre of the target. We also computed the eye velocity during fixation, using a moving window algorithm of 11 ms, to detect microsaccades within the period of fixation."
    "**Smooth Pursuit:** Participants viewed a white dot (diameter 0.5°) moving horizontally at 10°/s across the screen for 10 s, reversing direction 6 times. Smooth pursuit was assessed by the open-loop gain, defined as the ratio of average eye velocity to average target velocity during smooth pursuit."
    "Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York, USA). Group differences at baseline and follow-up were analysed using independent samples t-tests or Mann–Whitney U tests, as appropriate. Longitudinal changes were analysed using paired samples t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Correlations between oculomotor variables and clinical scores were performed using Spearman's rho."

    **Results:**
    "At baseline, PD patients demonstrated significantly worse smooth pursuit open-loop gain compared to HC (PD median 0.70, IQR 0.50–0.78; HC median 0.81, IQR 0.72–0.90; U = 162.5, p = 0.009)."
    "There were no significant differences in fixation stability (MAE or eye velocity) between groups at baseline."
    "After 3 years, PD patients showed a significant decline in smooth pursuit open-loop gain (baseline median 0.70, IQR 0.50–0.78; 3-year median 0.60, IQR 0.45–0.70; Z = − 2.75, p = 0.006)."
    "HC demonstrated no significant change in smooth pursuit open-loop gain over 3 years (baseline median 0.81, IQR 0.72–0.90; 3-year median 0.79, IQR 0.70–0.88; Z = − 0.44, p = 0.66)."
    "At 3 years, PD patients had significantly worse smooth pursuit gain compared to HC (PD median 0.60, IQR 0.45–0.70; HC median 0.79, IQR 0.70–0.88; U = 127.5, p = 0.001)."
    "PD patients also showed a significant increase in fixation eye velocity over 3 years (baseline median 7.02 deg/s, IQR 5.86–9.09; 3-year median 7.91 deg/s, IQR 6.31–10.15; Z = − 2.37, p = 0.018), indicating worsened fixation stability."
    "HC showed no significant change in fixation eye velocity (baseline median 6.30 deg/s, IQR 5.25–7.31; 3-year median 6.38 deg/s, IQR 5.42–7.50; Z = − 0.38, p = 0.70)."
    "At 3 years, PD patients had significantly higher fixation eye velocity than HC (PD median 7.91 deg/s, IQR 6.31–10.15; HC median 6.38 deg/s, IQR 5.42–7.50; U = 148.5, p = 0.01)."
    "No significant change was observed in fixation MAE in either group."
    "Changes in smooth pursuit open-loop gain over 3 years correlated with changes in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (motor score) (rho = − 0.45, p = 0.03) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score (rho = 0.47, p = 0.02) in PD patients."
    "Changes in fixation eye velocity did not correlate with changes in clinical scores."

    **Discussion:**
    "This study demonstrates that patients with PD show a significant decline in smooth pursuit gain and an increase in fixation eye velocity over a 3-year period, which is not observed in healthy controls."
    "The decline in smooth pursuit gain in PD correlated with motor and cognitive deterioration, suggesting its potential as a quantitative biomarker of PD progression."
    "The increase in fixation eye velocity in PD, which was independent of changes in clinical scores, may reflect a subtle underlying neurological process that manifests prior to overt clinical changes."
    "Our finding that fixation eye velocity increased in PD patients over 3 years, while fixation MAE did not, suggests that the change might be due to an increase in the number or amplitude of microsaccades or other small drifts, rather than a gross displacement of the gaze from the target."
    "The correlation of smooth pursuit decline with motor and cognitive scores highlights its potential as a clinical biomarker."

4.  **Large verbatim excerpts from methods/results/discussion:**
    **Methods:**
    "Participants were recruited through the UC San Francisco Memory and Aging Center (MAC) and included healthy controls (HC; N = 40), patients with typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD; N = 26), posterior cortical atrophy (PCA; N = 12), and logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA; N = 20). All participants underwent baseline and longitudinal assessments. Follow-up varied between 6 months and 3 years, with a median of 12 months (IQR: 6–20 months). Eye movements were recorded using an EyeLink 1000 Plus (SR Research, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) at 1000 Hz, with participants seated 60 cm from a 24-inch monitor."
    "**Smooth pursuit:** Participants followed a small red circle (0.5° visual angle) moving horizontally at 10°/s across a grey screen. Pursuit gain was calculated as the ratio of eye velocity to target velocity during periods of smooth pursuit."
    "**Fixation stability:** Participants fixated a central cross for 30 seconds. Fixation stability was quantified by the root mean square (RMS) of horizontal and vertical gaze positions. Higher RMS indicates worse stability."
    "Statistical analyses involved linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) to examine longitudinal changes, controlling for age, sex, and education. Baseline differences were analyzed using ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis, followed by post-hoc comparisons. Effect sizes were reported using Cohen's d for pairwise comparisons."

    **Results:**
    "At baseline, all AD variants (tAD, PCA, lvPPA) showed significantly lower smooth pursuit gain compared to HC (tAD vs HC: p < .001, d = 0.95; PCA vs HC: p < .001, d = 1.10; lvPPA vs HC: p < .001, d = 0.88)."
    "Fixation stability (RMS) was significantly worse in PCA patients compared to HC at baseline (p = .003, d = 0.78), but not in tAD or lvPPA patients."
    "Longitudinally, LMEMs revealed a significant decline in smooth pursuit gain across all AD variants over time (tAD: β = −0.007, p < .001; PCA: β = −0.008, p < .001; lvPPA: β = −0.006, p = .002). No significant longitudinal change in smooth pursuit gain was observed in HC (β = 0.001, p = .62)."
    "The rate of decline in smooth pursuit gain was significantly greater in PCA compared to HC (p < .01) and tAD (p < .05)."
    "For fixation stability (RMS), only PCA patients showed a significant longitudinal worsening (β = 0.004, p = .001). No significant longitudinal change in RMS was observed in tAD, lvPPA, or HC groups."
    "The longitudinal worsening of fixation stability in PCA was significantly greater than in HC (p < .001) and tAD (p < .01)."
    "Longitudinal decline in smooth pursuit gain significantly correlated with longitudinal decline in global cognition (MMSE) across all AD variants (β = 0.002, p = .001) and specifically with executive function decline (β = 0.003, p < .001)."
    "Longitudinal worsening of fixation stability in PCA correlated with worsening visual perceptual scores (β = 0.005, p = .003)."

    **Discussion:**
    "Our longitudinal study confirms that oculomotor abnormalities are evident in AD variants and worsen over time, suggesting their potential as quantitative biomarkers for disease progression."
    "Smooth pursuit gain declined significantly across all AD variants over a median of 12 months, whereas healthy controls showed no significant change. This provides strong evidence for smooth pursuit as a sensitive biomarker for AD progression."
    "Fixation stability (RMS) worsened longitudinally specifically in PCA, which is consistent with the visuospatial deficits prominent in this AD variant."
    "The differential longitudinal changes across AD variants, particularly the more pronounced decline in smooth pursuit and fixation stability in PCA, highlight the potential of eye movement measures to track variant-specific progression."
    "The correlations with global and domain-specific cognitive measures further support the clinical relevance of these eye movement biomarkers."
5.  **Quantitative details exactly as reported:**
    *   **Sample Size:** Healthy controls (HC; N = 40), typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD; N = 26), posterior cortical atrophy (PCA; N = 12), logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA; N = 20).
    *   **Baseline Smooth Pursuit Gain (Cohen's d vs HC):** tAD: d = 0.95 (p < .001); PCA: d = 1.10 (p < .001); lvPPA: d = 0.88 (p < .001).
    *   **Baseline Fixation Stability (RMS) (Cohen's d vs HC):** PCA: d = 0.78 (p = .003). No significant difference for tAD or lvPPA.
    *   **Longitudinal Decline in Smooth Pursuit Gain (β, p):** tAD: β = −0.007, p < .001; PCA: β = −0.008, p < .001; lvPPA: β = −0.006, p = .002. HC: β = 0.001, p = .62.
    *   **Rate of Decline in Smooth Pursuit Gain:** Significantly greater in PCA vs HC (p < .01) and PCA vs tAD (p < .05).
    *   **Longitudinal Worsening of Fixation Stability (RMS) (β, p):** PCA: β = 0.004, p = .001. No significant change for tAD, lvPPA, or HC.
    *   **Rate of Worsening in Fixation Stability (RMS):** Significantly greater in PCA vs HC (p < .001) and PCA vs tAD (p < .01).
    *   **Correlations:** Longitudinal decline in smooth pursuit gain correlated with MMSE (β = 0.002, p = .001) and executive function decline (β = 0.003, p < .001). Longitudinal worsening of fixation stability in PCA correlated with visual perceptual scores (β = 0.005, p = .003).

4.  **Large verbatim excerpts from methods/results/discussion:**
    **Methods:**
    "This longitudinal study recruited 23 genetically confirmed SCA3 patients and 23 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) from 2013 to 2018 at National Taiwan University Hospital. The follow-up interval was 18.2 ± 3.4 months (range 12–25 months). Eye movements were recorded with an infrared eye-tracking system (EyeLink 1000, SR Research Ltd., Ottawa, ON, Canada) at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. Participants were seated 55 cm from a 19-inch CRT monitor (resolution 1024 × 768 pixels, refresh rate 100 Hz)."
    "**Fixation stability:** Participants fixated a central red cross (0.6° visual angle) for 30 s. Fixation stability was quantified by calculating the horizontal and vertical root mean square (RMS) of gaze position (RMSX and RMSY, respectively) and the horizontal and vertical standard deviation (SDX and SDY) of gaze position."
    "**Smooth Pursuit:** Participants tracked a red target (0.6° visual angle) oscillating sinusoidally horizontally at 0.2 Hz with amplitude 10°. Smooth pursuit gain was calculated as the ratio of peak eye velocity to peak target velocity during smooth pursuit segments."
    "Statistical analyses included independent t-tests or Mann–Whitney U tests for baseline group comparisons. Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for longitudinal changes within groups. Linear mixed models were used to analyze longitudinal changes between groups, accounting for baseline values and follow-up duration. Correlations were assessed using Spearman's rho."

    **Results:**
    "At baseline, SCA3 patients showed significantly higher RMSX (SCA3 mean 0.45 ± 0.17 deg; HC mean 0.19 ± 0.04 deg; p < 0.001) and RMSY (SCA3 mean 0.35 ± 0.17 deg; HC mean 0.17 ± 0.05 deg; p < 0.001) during fixation compared to HC."
    "Smooth pursuit gain was significantly lower in SCA3 patients at baseline compared to HC (SCA3 mean 0.58 ± 0.14; HC mean 0.92 ± 0.03; p < 0.001)."
    "Longitudinally, SCA3 patients showed a significant worsening of fixation stability, indicated by an increase in RMSX (baseline mean 0.45 ± 0.17 deg; follow-up mean 0.54 ± 0.21 deg; p = 0.001) and RMSY (baseline mean 0.35 ± 0.17 deg; follow-up mean 0.41 ± 0.18 deg; p = 0.001)."
    "HC showed no significant longitudinal changes in fixation stability (RMSX: baseline mean 0.19 ± 0.04 deg; follow-up mean 0.19 ± 0.04 deg; p = 0.72; RMSY: baseline mean 0.17 ± 0.05 deg; follow-up mean 0.17 ± 0.05 deg; p = 0.88)."
    "Smooth pursuit gain in SCA3 patients also showed a significant longitudinal decline (baseline mean 0.58 ± 0.14; follow-up mean 0.51 ± 0.16; p = 0.002)."
    "HC showed no significant longitudinal change in smooth pursuit gain (baseline mean 0.92 ± 0.03; follow-up mean 0.91 ± 0.04; p = 0.15)."
    "Linear mixed models confirmed that SCA3 patients had a significantly greater rate of change in RMSX (β = 0.004 deg/month, p = 0.001), RMSY (β = 0.003 deg/month, p = 0.001), and smooth pursuit gain (β = −0.003 /month, p = 0.001) compared to HC."
    "Longitudinal worsening of smooth pursuit gain correlated significantly with increasing scores on the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) total score (rho = −0.52, p = 0.01) and motor subscores."
    "Longitudinal worsening of fixation stability (RMSX and RMSY) also correlated with SARA total score progression (RMSX: rho = 0.48, p = 0.02; RMSY: rho = 0.45, p = 0.03)."

    **Discussion:**
    "Our longitudinal study confirms that individuals with SCA3 exhibit progressive worsening of fixation stability and smooth pursuit deficits over an average of 18 months."
    "These progressive oculomotor impairments correlate with the clinical progression of ataxia severity, as measured by the SARA score, highlighting their potential as objective biomarkers for disease progression in SCA3."
    "The worsening of fixation stability in SCA3 is characterized by increasing RMS values, which can be attributed to increased square wave jerks or gaze-evoked nystagmus, often exacerbated in cerebellar diseases."
    "The decline in smooth pursuit gain is a well-established feature of cerebellar degeneration, and our longitudinal findings further solidify its role as a progression marker."
    "The significant rates of change observed in these oculomotor parameters over a relatively short follow-up period suggest their utility in clinical trials for tracking disease modification."
